**Important Setup Notes:**

- **No Fan Setup**: Modify the BT (Bean Temperature) values to match your PID curve
- **With Fan Setup**: Use ET (Environmental Temperature) values as fan percentages
  - Example: 50Â°C ET = 50% fan speed at that time point

### Adjust Your Temperature Profile

You'll see a graph with **control points (nodes)** that you can move:

**How to Edit:**

- **ðŸ”µ Blue line (BT)** = Bean Temperature profile
- **ðŸ”´ Red line (ET)** = Fan speed percentage (if using fan)
- **Drag points up/down** = Change temperature/fan values
- **Drag points left/right** = Adjust timing

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Each point represents a key moment in your roast. Think about when you want temperature changes to happen.

### Preview Your Changes

Take a moment to review your curve and make sure it looks like the roasting profile you want to achieve.
